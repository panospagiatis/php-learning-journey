# PHP Learning Project: Password Guessing Game

This is a simple PHP script I wrote as a beginner to practice logic and loops. It's a terminal-based game where the user has a limited number of tries to guess a secret word.

### How it works

The program uses a while loop to keep the game running until the user either guesses the correct password or runs out of attempts (5 tries).

### Key concepts used

- While loops and break statements
- User input using STDIN
- String comparison
- Using a "flag" variable to check for a win/loss state

### How to run it

In your terminal, navigate to this folder and type:
php guess-password.php
