# PHP Learning Journey

This repository contains a collection of PHP scripts developed as part of my learning path in PHP (& Laravel).

## Project Files

### [Price Calculator](./price-calculator.php)

A CLI tool that calculates monthly membership fees.

- **Key Features:** Uses PHP 8 match expressions, exception handling (try/catch), and ternary operators for discount logic.

### [Password Guessing Game](./guess-password.php)

A terminal-based game focused on control flow and user interaction.

- **Key Features:** Uses a 'while' loop with a maximum of 5 attempts, a "flag" variable ($isCorrect) to track state, and `break` statements to exit the loop upon success.

### [Greeting Function](./greeting.php)

A script that asks for a name and prints a personalized greeting.

- **Key Features:** Function definitions, type hinting (string), and checking input length with 'strlen()'.

## How to Run

To run any of these programs, use the PHP command in your terminal:
